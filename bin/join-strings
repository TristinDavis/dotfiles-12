# Join strings together with a delimiter
#
# This is sometimes preferable to `paste -d',' - - -` because the number of
# fields does not need to be known in advance and whitespace is preserved.
#
# Usage:
#
#   printf '%s\n' foo bar baz | join-strings
#   printf '%s\n' foo bar baz | join-strings '-'
