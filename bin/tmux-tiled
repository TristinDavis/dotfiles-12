# Quick wrapper to make a bunch of tiled tmux panes
#
# Needed because select-layout is needed after each split-window to retain
# a tiled layout. Toggle remain-on-exit beforehand as desired.
#
# Examples:
#
# echo app{1..10}.example.com | xargs -n1 tmux-tiled ssh
# FIXME: cal will scroll the content off-screen in some panes. Why?
# echo jan mar april | xargs -n1 tmux-tiled cal -m
# echo {2015..2019} | xargs -n1 tmux-tiled cal -y
